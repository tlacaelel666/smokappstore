        "Terms of use
        The following terms and conditions govern
        the use of the services provided on "oneDload.com".
        By accessing or using the "smapp.website"(hereafter referred to as "ddekows").

        1. The use of ddekows is governed by Mexican law
        with the following modifications and explanations to be considered.

        2. ddekows offers a technical service on a voluntary basis.
        Hence, ddekows does not take liability for the service
        working unimpeded or for permanent availability of the service.

        3. ddekows must only be used for private purposes.
        Any commercial use of ddekows is strictly forbidden
        and will be pursued in a court of law.

        4. ddekows is only to be used to access content which was posted
        onto the hosting platform by an authorised third party.
        The user is obliged to check respective rights concerning the content.

        5. Accessing pornographic content or such content that infringes any right
        in any other way is strictly forbidden.
        to convert files that are not publicly available.
        In case a third party right is already violated by downloading the content,
        the user bears complete responsibility for this as he started the processing
        of the data in question.

        6. Accessing the systems or services of ddekows
        in any way other than the intended use is forbidden.

        7. It is the only purpose of ddekows to create a copy of downloadable
        online-content for the private use of the user
        (fair use). Any further use of the content transmitted by ddekows,
        particularly but not exclusively making the content publicly accessible
        or using it commercially, must be agreed upon with the holder of the rights
        of the respective downloaded content.
        The user bears full responsibility for all actions related
        to the data transmitted by ddekows.
        ddekows does not grant any rights to the contents,
        as it only acts as a technical service provider.

        8. The user carries full responsibility for checking
        the legitimacy of his use of ddekows.
        ddekows only provides the technical service.
        Hence, ddekows does not take liability towards the user
        or any third party for the permissibility
        of downloading content through ddekows.

        9. Our platform contains links to external
        websites of third parties, the contents of which cannot be influenced by us.
        Thus, we cannot take responsibility for this content.
        The responsibility lies with the respective provider or host of the websites
        in question. All linked websites were checked for violations
        of rights at the time of establishing the link.
        There was no suspicion of illegal content at that time.
        Continuous checking of the linked websites, however, is not reasonable without
        any concrete evidence of a right's violation.
        Should we be informed about any rights violation,
        we will immediately delete such links.

        10. Should individual provisions
        of these present terms and conditions be or become ineffective,
        this shall not affect the effectiveness of the remaining provisions.
        The ineffective provision shall be replaced by a substitute provision
        regulating the intended purpose of the ineffective provision as precisely
        as possible".
